Two cover stories: 1) toxic compounds, and 2) purchase offers.


#1: Toxic Compound Game

In this experiment you will play the role of a biologist. 
Your job is to learn how two compounds (A and B) affect whether 
a cell survives or dies.

To learn about the effects of these two compounds, you will run a 
series of tests in which you specify the levels of each that are 
injected in the cell. You will then be told whether or not the 
cell survived or died.

At various points during the experiment, you will be shown a series 
of new cells and the level of compounds in them. You will be asked
to predict whether that cell will die or survive. For every prediction
you get right, you will be paid a small bonus.


#2: Alien Trading Game

In this experiment you will play the role of a merchant who has 
arrived in a new country where you don't speak the language. You 

You have two resources to offer: resource A and resource B. To learn about
what kinds of offers the merchant will accept or reject, you will make a 
series of proposed offers in which you specify the amount of each resource
that you are willing to trade. You will then be told whether the proposal 
would be accepted or rejected.

At various points during the experiment, you will be shown a series of 
potential offers with the corresponding levels of each resource. You will be
asked to predict whether that offer will be accepted or rejected by the merchant.
For each decision that you correctly predict, you will be paid a small bonus.
